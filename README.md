# -C-plus-plus-Projects

All of my C++ projects here on Github,except for one, have been on in-house engine given to us in a class. However this engine has no documentation at all and it is upon the students to figure out the codebase and implement the features. The engine given to us only supports basic rendering and model import. I worked on varipus aspects of the engine which include networking, gameplay, shaders and audio system. 

Because the engine is not totally mine, I cannot put up all the files related to a project. The files which were created by me and comprise of the code that I have written are the ones available here. I have complete rights over these files and represent mywork completely.
